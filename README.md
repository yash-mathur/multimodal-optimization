Abstract
This thesis investigates a fairly new differential evolution algorithm variation proposed by  Brest et  al. [1],  The  algorithm  proposed  by  them  uses  several  techniques  that  improve the algorithm’s efficiency.  The algorithm uses self-adaptive parameter control, clustering and crowding methods.  Included in the algorithm is a clustering mechanism, that aimsto improve the efficiency of the algorithm by creating subpopulations, used to determinepopulation size and replacing the ’bad’ individuals in a population.  The algorithm aimsto remove these individuals as they prevent the best individuals from converging to theoptimum.  The algorithm is therefore, trying to replace the bad individuals with individ-uals that are close to the best individuals.This improved variant of Differential Evolution, is used on a complex Head Related Trans-fer Function, allowing us to generate subpopulations and finding the best individuals.
