<!-- ABSTRACT -->
### Abstract
This thesis investigates a fairly new differential evolution algorithm variation proposed by  Brest et  al. [1],  The  algorithm  proposed  by  them  uses  several  techniques  that  improve the algorithm’s efficiency.  The algorithm uses self-adaptive parameter control, clustering and crowding methods.  Included in the algorithm is a clustering mechanism, that aim is to improve the efficiency of the algorithm by creating subpopulations, used to determine population size and replacing the ’bad’ individuals in a population.  The algorithm aimsto remove these individuals as they prevent the best individuals from converging to the optimum.  The algorithm is therefore, trying to replace the bad individuals with individuals that are close to the best individuals.This improved variant of Differential Evolution, is used on a complex Head Related Transfer Function, allowing us to generate subpopulations and finding the best individuals.

**The main code resides in the Python Notebook (Optimization Notebook.ipynb), Also included are the python scripts for helper functions.**
